Bandom is a full-stack web application inspired by Bandcamp, a music-sharing
website and marketplace between "fans" (users), artists, and labels.
Bandom uses Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database,
and React.js with Redux framework on the frontend.

### Features and Implementation

1. Artist & Album Show Pages

- Users can view other artist's pages that display all of the artist's discography,
as well as view the full information for a specific album, including background
information on the album and its full track list

2. Song Player

- Users can preview and play through tracks in album show page

3. Download Songs

- Users can download a track to their computer from their own page or other artists'
pages

4. User Authentication

- features login and sign up options in separate pages as well as links to these pages while
browsing, as well as a signup modal that redirects to signup form

### Future Directions for the Project

In addition to the features already implemented, I plan to continue work on this project. The next steps for Bandom are outlined below:

- Search Bar - to search for fans, artists, albums, and tracks

- Creating, Editing, and Deleting tracks and albums in a user's own collection

- Follows: Allowing users to follow each other and artist pages

- Large-scale Playback: Bigger Viewer of current song that's playing, with album art as background.

- Favorites: Users can favorite each other's collections and access them in their Favorite Collections
